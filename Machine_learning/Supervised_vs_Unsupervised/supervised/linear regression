# Linear Regression in Machine Learning

## Overview

Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that learns from labeled datasets. It maps the data points to the most optimized linear functions, which can be used to predict outcomes on new datasets.

## Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. The labeled data contains input-output pairs where the target value is known. There are two main types of supervised learning:

- **Classification**: Predicts the class or category of the dataset, like determining if an image is of a cat or a dog.
- **Regression**: Predicts continuous output variables based on input features, like estimating house prices based on size, location, etc.

## Types of Linear Regression

- **Simple Linear Regression**: A model with one independent feature predicting one target variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: A model with more than one independent feature predicting a single target variable.
- **Univariate Linear Regression**: A model with one dependent variable.
- **Multivariate Linear Regression**: A model with multiple dependent variables.

## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Method

Linear regression models often use the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

## Gradient Descent Algorithm

Another approach to optimizing linear regression models is the Gradient Descent Algorithm, which iteratively adjusts the model parameters to minimize the error.
