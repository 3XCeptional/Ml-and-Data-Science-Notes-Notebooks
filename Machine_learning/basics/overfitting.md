# Overfitting in Machine Learning

Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning where a model learns the details and noise in the training data to such an extent that it negatively impacts the modelâ€™s performance on new data. Below is a more detailed explanation.

## What is Overfitting?
When a model is overfitted, it becomes too complex and captures random fluctuations and noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. This results in a model that performs very well on the training data but poorly on unseen data (test data or real-world data).

## Causes of Overfitting
1. **Too Complex Models**: Using models with too many parameters relative to the number of observations can lead to overfitting. For example, a deep neural network with many layers and neurons can easily overfit if not properly regularized.
2. **Insufficient Training Data**: When there is not enough training data, the model may learn the noise and peculiarities of the limited data available.
3. **Too Many Features**: Including too many irrelevant features can cause the model to learn noise rather than the signal.

## Signs of Overfitting
- **High Accuracy on Training Data**: The model shows very high accuracy on the training data.
- **Low Accuracy on Test Data**: The model performs poorly on the test data, indicating that it has not generalized well.

## How to Prevent Overfitting
1. **Simplify the Model**: Use a less complex model with fewer parameters.
2. **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 or L2 regularization add a penalty for larger coefficients, discouraging the model from fitting the noise.
3. **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model performs well on different subsets of the data.
4. **More Training Data**: Increasing the amount of training data can help the model learn the underlying patterns better.
5. **Feature Selection**: Remove irrelevant or less important features to reduce the complexity of the model.
