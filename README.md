## Overview

This repository contains notes and explanations on:

- **Supervised Learning**: Explore classification and regression tasks, including commonly used algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Learn about clustering techniques like K-Means, anomaly detection, and other algorithms that don't rely on labeled data.
- **Key Concepts**: Topics like overfitting, train/test splits, performance metrics (e.g., RAE, RSS), and cross-validation are covered to improve your understanding of model evaluation and optimization.
- **Statistics**: Dive into statistical concepts such as standard deviation, variance, and error metrics for better data analysis.
- **Git Commands**: Learn helpful Git commands and workflows specific to machine learning projects.
